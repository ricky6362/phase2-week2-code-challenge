# Project Name
 
 Bot Battlr

 ## Description
 The "Bot Battlr" app aims to provide users with an interactive platform to create and manage their own unique army of virtual robots. The app features two main sections: the "Bot Collection" and the "Bot Army." In the "Bot Collection" section, users can explore a diverse selection of robot profiles, each characterized by a name, catchphrase, health, damage, and armor attributes. By clicking on a robot card, users can add it to their favorite bots collection, effectively assembling their desired army. The "Bot Army" section displays the user's selected robots, allowing them to view and manage their assembled team. Additionally, the app demonstrates the use of React components, FontAwesome icons, and asynchronous data fetching to deliver an engaging and seamless user experience. With the "Bot Battlr Builder," users can unleash their creativity and strategic prowess as they curate an army of powerful virtual robots.
